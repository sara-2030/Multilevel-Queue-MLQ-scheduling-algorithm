Implementing a Multilevel Queue (MLQ) scheduling algorithm with two queues This project will involve implementing a Multilevel Queue (MLQ) scheduling algorithm with two queues, system processes queue numbered as Q1 and batch processes queue numbered as Q2 with specific assigned priority for each queue (Q1 has a higher priority than Q2). Each process must occupy the respective queue with specific priority range according to its priority (1 or 2). The scheduler follows non-preemptive Shortest-Job-First (SJF) scheduling algorithm for processes in Q1 and First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm for processes in Q2. The multilevel queue-scheduling algorithm is implemented as a fixed preemptive priority scheduling for each and every queue. It is assumed that processes arrive at different times, so your scheduler have to support higher-priority processes preempting processes with lower priorities when process arrives at high priority queue.
